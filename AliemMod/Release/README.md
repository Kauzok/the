*someone get me some cool screenshots pls*

### Leap
Leap on to enemies and ride them, then chomp their heads off

### Weapons
There are different primary weapons to choose from.
- Repeatedly press to shoot normally, and hold for an alternate fire that can charge up!
- (You don't have to break your fingers. So long as you are pressing at a reasonable pace, you are considered mashing, and the weapon will fire at max attack speed.)
