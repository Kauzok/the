  - all funcitonality will work fine on your screen, but for others animations may be wonky

## Changelog
`1.0.0`
- increased projectile size of ray gun with respect to enemies but not world
- reworked kit
- added laser sword
- allow shooting while diving and riding
- severely improved riding presentation
- updated a lot of animations (thanks rob!)
- added shank on close range ray gun (in reference to the original game)

`0.3.2`
- increased damage on ray gun
  - *projectile is harder to hit (especially in mp), so it can afford to do higher than commando-tier damage*
- increased chomp heal from 10% max health to 30%
- lowered chomp cooldown and damage
- chomp now has `BonusToLowHealth` damage type  

*these changes should hopefully make his kit flow a little better, and give some needed buffs*  
*(from what I know. If I buffed him too much let me know)*

  - config for always ride
  - you're welcome, contra c:
- slightly toned down the range on riding detecting
- readded hitbox to leap
- added scepter why not
- added another silly way to shoot raygun in cursed
- moved up aim origin so projectiles hit the floor less
- reordered so he's not in between tesla trooper and desolator
- fixed stats not being to vanilla standard

`0.3.0`
- fixed projectiles in multiplayer
- fixed riding error spam in multiplayer
- networked riding position for clients. 
  - *each player will see their proper riding position on their screen, but on other screens they will floating behind*
- can now ride allies, which gives them a movement buff
  - *was already giving enemies a movement buff to simulate panicking. simply applies to allies as well*
- chomp now heals for 10% of max health
- borrowed some sounds from the game for his projectiles' impacts
- added his upper and lower jaw to ragdoll

*likely (hopefully, barring bugs) my last update for this guy until I sometime later decide to revisit him*  
*have fun and thanks for havin fun c:*
